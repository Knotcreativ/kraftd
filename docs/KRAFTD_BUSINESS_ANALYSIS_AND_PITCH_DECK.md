## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Competition from incumbents** | HIGH | Native GCC platform, vertical focus, AI integration, focus on mid-market not enterprise |
| **Customer acquisition costs too high** | HIGH | Channel partnerships, product-led growth, strong unit economics (allows high CAC) |
| **Technology disruption (new AI models)** | MEDIUM | Modular architecture, API-based model switching, continuous training |
| **Data privacy regulations** | MEDIUM | Multi-region deployment, GDPR/PDPA compliance, data localization (UAE North) |
| **Key person dependency** | MEDIUM | Advisory board, documented processes, hire COO early, equity incentives |
| **Market downturn affects procurement budgets** | MEDIUM | Focus on ROI/cost savings (not efficiency), flexible pricing, enterprise lock-in |
| **Product execution delays** | MEDIUM | Phased rollout prioritized, external contractors for scalability, clear roadmap |
| **Supplier viability (Azure services)** | LOW | Multi-cloud roadiness, AWS alternative planned, self-hosted option for enterprise |
