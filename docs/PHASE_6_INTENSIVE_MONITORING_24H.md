```

### Critical Incident Response

**Incident Declared: Service Down (EXAMPLE)**

```
[TIME] INCIDENT DECLARED

1. INITIAL RESPONSE (0-2 minutes)
   ✓ Alert triggers in monitoring system
   ✓ Page on-call engineer
   ✓ Automatic Slack/email notification to team
   ✓ Status page: SET TO "INVESTIGATING"

2. TRIAGE (2-5 minutes)
   ✓ Determine scope (which component failed?)
   ✓ Assess impact (how many users affected?)
   ✓ Activate incident commander
   ✓ Open incident war room (Zoom + Slack)

3. INVESTIGATION (5-15 minutes)
   ✓ Check logs for root cause
   ✓ Compare metrics to baseline
   ✓ Check recent deployments
   ✓ Verify infrastructure status

4. MITIGATION (15-30 minutes)
   ✓ If recent deployment: ROLLBACK to previous version
   ✓ If infrastructure: FAILOVER to backup
   ✓ If database: RESTORE from backup
   ✓ Communicate progress to stakeholders

5. RESOLUTION (30-60 minutes)
   ✓ Service restored
   ✓ Validation of fix
   ✓ Status page updated
   ✓ Begin incident post-mortem

Example Timeline:
[05:45] Critical alert: API service down
[05:47] On-call engineer paged
[05:50] Scope identified: Backend container crashed
[05:52] Investigation: OOM (Out of Memory) error
[05:58] Action: Restart container, increase memory limit
[06:02] Service restored: ✅ API responding
[06:05] Status updated: ✅ Monitoring normal operations
[06:30] Post-mortem: Document root cause and prevent recurrence
```

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Issue 1: High Response Time (Latency Spike)**
```
Symptom: P99 latency jumps from 1.8s to 5.0s
Root Cause: Database query performance degradation
Quick Fix:
  1. Check database slow query log
  2. Identify problematic query
  3. Check index effectiveness
  4. If needed, add temporary index
  5. Monitor for improvement
Time to Resolve: 5-10 minutes
```

**Issue 2: Error Rate Spike**
```
Symptom: Error rate jumps from 0.1% to 2%
Root Cause: Upstream service issue or code bug
Quick Fix:
  1. Check error logs for pattern
  2. Identify affected endpoint
  3. Check if recent code deployed
  4. If yes: ROLLBACK previous commit
  5. If no: Investigate external dependency
Time to Resolve: 5-15 minutes
```

**Issue 3: Memory Leak**
```
Symptom: Container memory gradually increases over hours
Root Cause: Memory not released after operations
Quick Fix:
  1. Monitor memory trend over time
  2. Correlate with API usage pattern
  3. Check for unclosed connections/file handles
  4. If critical: Restart container (causes brief 30s downtime)
  5. Fix root cause in code for next deployment
Time to Resolve: 1-2 hours (requires code fix)
```

**Issue 4: Database Connection Exhaustion**
```
Symptom: New requests fail with "No connections available"
Root Cause: Leak in connection pool or spike in demand
Quick Fix:
  1. Increase connection pool size temporarily
  2. Monitor for recovery
  3. Check if legitimate traffic spike
  4. If spike: Trigger auto-scaling (increase instances)
  5. If leak: Identify and fix connection handling
Time to Resolve: 5 minutes (temporary) + investigation
```

**Issue 5: Disk Space Filling**
```
Symptom: Disk space drops rapidly below 20% free
Root Cause: Logs filling disk or large file accumulation
Quick Fix:
  1. Check disk usage by directory
  2. Archive old logs
  3. Clear temporary files
  4. Check for runaway processes
  5. Monitor disk trend
Time to Resolve: 10-30 minutes
```
