## Document Maintenance

### Version Control Protocol

**When making updates:**
1. Create new version (v1.1, v1.2, etc. for minor changes)
2. Major redesigns → v2.0
3. Update last modified date
4. Note changes in CHANGELOG
5. Get review approval before merge

**Update process:**
```bash
git checkout -b docs/update-feature-specs
# Edit /docs/01-project/FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS_v1.0.md
# Or create v2.0 if major change
git commit -m "docs: update feature specifications for Q2"
git push origin docs/update-feature-specs
# Create PR for review
```

### Archival System

**Old versions moved to:** `/docs/_versions/`
- `FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS_v0.9.md` (deprecated)
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_v0.8.md` (deprecated)

**Deleted docs moved to:** `/docs/_archive/`
- For compliance/historical reference

## Recommendations for Usage

### Best Practices

1. **Keep docs updated with code**
   - When changing API, update API_CONTRACT
   - When changing schema, update DATABASE_SCHEMA
   - When changing architecture, update SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE

2. **Use as source of truth**
   - Questions? Check docs first
   - Design decisions? Reference TECHNICAL_DECISION_LOG
   - Implementation help? Check CODING_STANDARDS

3. **Regular review schedule**
   - Monthly: Skim architecture docs
   - Quarterly: Full review + updates
   - Yearly: Major review + refresh

4. **Team training**
   - Onboard all new members with ONBOARDING_GUIDE
   - Weekly architecture discussion (30 min)
   - Monthly deep-dive into one architecture area

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
